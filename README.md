📊 System Monitoring Dashboard + Auto-Responder (Demo Project)
This is a demo project that simulates system health monitoring and auto-generates support responses using the OpenAI GPT API. It's designed to demonstrate core skills in Python scripting, basic frontend, and automated IT support logic—perfect for learning and showcasing technical support capabilities.

🔧 Features
✅ Simulates system metrics: CPU, memory, disk, and uptime

⚠️ Triggers alerts based on usage thresholds

🤖 Auto-generates support replies using OpenAI GPT (or preset rules)

🖥️ Simple HTML dashboard for displaying system status and responses

🎯 Great for practicing IT support, automation, and frontend basics

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/AweSanjam/cloud-monitoring-dashboard.git
cd cloud-monitoring-dashboard
2. Install Python dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install psutil requests openai
3. Set your OpenAI API key
powershell
Copy
Edit
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"  # For PowerShell
# or
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"  # For Linux/macOS
4. Run the monitor script
bash
Copy
Edit
python monitor.py
5. Open the dashboard
Just double-click index.html or open it in any browser. It reads data.json generated by the script.
